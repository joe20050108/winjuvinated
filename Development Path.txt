THIS IS JUST A RANT TEXT FILE DONT TAKE WHAT I SAY IN HERE EVEN REMOTELY SERIOUSLY

Ideas for the development path of WinJS(WinJuvinated)
This is a literally a standard text file, but I wrote it in Visual Studio(NOT VSCODE)
I'm weird sometimes..

Anyways
WinJS 4.5 -- Some UI components properly redesigned / updated
	--(No electron)
	--JUST SOME
WinJS 4.6 -- Some UI components properly redesigned
	--To Remove
		- Electron Accents
		- Electron Titlebar
			(These features will be for WinJS 5.0 and will not be in WinJS 4.5 as of now)
	--Features: 
		Some UI components updated, but possible no color updates yet
			Or we might just have the currently redesigned WinUI3 components present
			and by version 5.0 have them ALL redesigned

WinJS 5.0 -- Full WinUI3 redesign process is completed
	--Most WinRT things should be able to support electron by this point

WinJS 6.0 -- Xenon Interpreter integration
	--Xenon is the XAML / XHML to HTML interpreter a developer(me) wrote.

WinJS 7.0 -- Two forks, WinUI3, and "FlexUI" (Codenamed: Potassium?)
	--FlexUI is an idea
